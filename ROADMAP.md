# Roadmap

What this tool is likely to do next, why, and — for the things deliberately not
being done — what would change that. Items move by being finished or by being
struck out with a reason; nothing here is a promise about a date.

## 1. Zotero as a second backend, then the primary one

**Why.** Mendeley's API is running on inertia. The developer portal's most
recent content is dated **2 November 2020**, and the last substantive change was
the February 2021 round that *removed* endpoints. There is no sunset notice and
no sign of maintenance either. Meanwhile Elsevier encrypted the local Mendeley
database, so Zotero's local importer only works against Mendeley Desktop 1.18,
from before the encryption; the supported migration path is an **online import
through the same API this tool depends on**. The escape route runs through the
thing that might fail, which is the argument for not being caught flat-footed.

Zotero, by contrast, is developed by a non-profit whose whole team it employs,
is open source, and keeps its data in a local SQLite database you can read
without asking anyone. The longevity case is not that the organization will
outlive Elsevier — it is that if it did not, the data is still readable.

**Exposure today is low and should be stated plainly**, so this is done
carefully rather than urgently: the mirror is one-way, so `library.bib`, the
page-marked extracts, `annotations/` and `findings/` are already a complete,
service-independent corpus. If the API went dark tonight, what stops is refresh
and filing — not the library.

**The hard part is not the API. It is the citation keys.**

`assign_citekeys` assigns a key once per *document id* and never changes it, and
those keys are cited in manuscripts and are the file names under `findings/`.
A naive re-import under Zotero item ids would reassign all ~2,700 of them: every
citation in a draft would rot and every findings file would orphan. So:

- [ ] Namespace the identifiers (`mendeley:<id>`, `zotero:<id>`) in
      `citekeys.json` and in `state.json`, which is keyed by Mendeley *file* id.
      This must land **before** any key is assigned from a second source.
- [ ] Write the migration map by matching old records to new: DOI first, then
      title+year, then by hand. Report the unmatched rather than guessing —
      roughly 17% of this library's records carry no DOI.
- [ ] Assert, as a test, that every pre-migration citation key still resolves to
      the same paper afterwards. This is the acceptance criterion; everything
      else is mechanics.

**The mechanics really are mechanics.** The Mendeley-specific surface in
`mendeley_mirror.py` is one base URL, one media type string, one `Mendeley`
class and two `document_id` references. Extraction, page markers, BibTeX,
annotations and findings all work on a generic document/file/annotation shape.

- [ ] **Test the escape hatch before relying on it** — run Zotero's online
      importer once into a throwaway profile and confirm items, attachments and
      annotations arrive intact. An exit nobody has tested is not an exit.
      *Note: the importer downloads every attachment — around 5–8 GB for this
      library. Not a thing to do on a hotel connection; it waits for home.*
- [ ] Abstract the client behind the small interface the rest of the code
      already implies: list documents, list files, fetch file, list annotations.
- [ ] Decide what "primary" means for the writing scripts (`inbox.py`,
      `mendeley_push.py`, `mendeley_edit.py`). They may only ever target one
      account; pointing them at the wrong one is the expensive mistake.

## 2. Make a failing refresh loud

**Why.** The failure this tool is least equipped to notice is silent
authentication death: the timer keeps firing, `mirror-status.md` keeps being
rewritten, and a reader three weeks later sees a file that *looks* maintained.
Every claim about mirror state has a shelf life of under an hour, and nothing
currently shouts when that stops being true.

- [ ] Distinguish an auth failure from a transient network failure in the status
      file and the log, and say which.
- [ ] Surface consecutive-failure count, so "failed once" and "has not succeeded
      in nine days" do not read the same.

This matters more given item 1: an auth failure is exactly the signal that says
*migrate now*, and it should not arrive as a shrug.

---

## 3. Continuous integration

**Why.** 220 offline checks that pass on one laptop and nowhere visible. Now
that the repo is licensed and published, a green badge is the cheapest possible
evidence that it works, and the test suite needs no credentials and no network.

- [ ] A GitHub Actions workflow running `uv run --script test_mirror.py` on push.
- [ ] Run it on Windows as well as Linux — the Windows launchers exist precisely
      because that platform behaves differently, and nothing tests them.

---

## 4. Better page-offset derivation

**Why.** Measured against the 2,129 extracts whose bib entry records a numeric
first page, the edge scan is right on 1,703, **wrong on 227**, and refuses 199.
Every one of those 227 is a plausible-looking journal page that nobody will
re-check. Two real failures this month came out of that set.

- [ ] Use the positional scan (`confirm_offset`) on the 199 refusals in some way
      that does not import its 70% precision into unattended records — a second
      opinion that must agree with the first, rather than a fallback.
- [ ] Treat the bib page range as evidence when the record has one. The
      derivation currently ignores a number the library already knows.

## Deliberately not doing

**Packaging (PyPI, conda-forge, console entry points).** The PEP 723 headers
mean `uv run --script` needs nothing installed, which is what makes this work on
a bare Windows laptop. A package would add a release process paid on every
change, for the benefit of users who do not exist yet.
*What would change it:* a second person needing to install it, or a machine in
the fleet that should run it without a clone.

**A pyproject.toml purely to deduplicate the ten dependency headers.** The test
suite now checks that every header matches what its script actually imports, and
fails on both a forgotten dependency and a spurious one. The duplication is
visible and verified rather than silent.

**Rewriting the test runner as pytest.** It is a bespoke runner, which is
unusual, but it is offline, dependency-light and prints a line per check. The
cost of converting is paid immediately and the benefit arrives with the first
outside contributor.
*What would change it:* an outside contributor.
