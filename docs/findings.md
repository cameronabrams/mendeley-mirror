# Findings

A record of what was asked of a paper and where the answer sat — the one hand-written directory in an otherwise generated mirror.

## Findings: what was asked, and where the answer was

The mirror preserves what a paper *says*. `finding.py` preserves what was *asked* of
it, so a question answered once is not re-derived from nothing six months later.

```
uv run --script finding.py --key Jo2007Automated \
    --question "does it optimize the protein's embedding?" \
    --page 2 --asked-by pestifer-manuscript \
    --quote "one should align it in a local machine and then upload it"
```

Records land in `findings/<citekey>.md`, one file per paper, **append-only**. A
finding later found wrong gets a `RETRACTED` record pointing at it and the original
stays, so how long a wrong claim stood is visible rather than tidied away. A
`CHECKED` record is likewise appended, carrying who checked and when — which makes
"what fraction of these has anyone verified?" a question with an answer.

Two properties do the real work:

- **The quote is verified before the record is written.** It must actually appear in
  `text/<citekey>.md` under the marker page claimed for it, after Unicode and
  whitespace normalization. A quote that cannot be found is refused, not filed with a
  warning. If it turns up on a different page, the error says which.
- **The page offset is derived, never trusted.** `finding.py` reads the recurring
  page number out of each page's running head or footer and takes the offset a
  majority of pages agree on. On fourteen papers whose offsets had been worked out by
  hand it got thirteen right and refused the fourteenth — a two-page note with no
  usable footer. It has never returned a wrong offset, which is the property that
  matters: a refusal costs a minute, a wrong locator ships.

**A record locates a passage; it never substitutes for one.** Consulted instead of
the extract it becomes a paraphrase indistinguishable from the source, which is what
deterministic extraction exists to prevent. Every file says so in its own header.
