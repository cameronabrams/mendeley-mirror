pdbxref.py -- structures the library cites whose primary papers it does not hold.

`pdbrefs.py` reads accessions out of the mirrored text. This asks RCSB what paper
each one came from, and checks that paper against `library.bib`.

    uv run --script pdbxref.py                  # ranked summary
    uv run --script pdbxref.py --min 3          # only what 3+ papers reach for
    uv run --script pdbxref.py --tsv gap.tsv    # full table

**Rank by how many LIBRARY PAPERS reach for a structure, not by how many
structures share a paper.** Those are different questions and only the first one
is useful. A single deposition often lands a dozen entries at once, so ranking by
entry count promotes whichever group deposited in bulk. Ranked by demand instead,
the shape of this library's own field appears at the top -- and in practice ~80%
of the gap is wanted by exactly one paper, which usually means somebody borrowed
coordinates rather than needing the argument.

**This produces a prompt, not a want-list.** That a structure keeps being reached
for is evidence the paper might be worth holding; whether it actually is depends
on what the structure is being used FOR, which is a judgment about the science and
belongs to the person whose library it is.

**Two things it cannot see.** An entry with no primary-citation DOI in RCSB is
invisible here rather than absent -- older depositions especially. And accessions
RCSB does not recognize at all are reported separately: some are obsoleted
entries, some are false positives escaping `pdbrefs.py`, and either way that count
is the only external measurement of the local index's precision. Read it as such.

**Unlike a paper, a PDB entry is not frozen.** Entries get re-refined, superseded
and obsoleted, so an answer here is true on the day it was asked. Output carries
the date for that reason; a claim about a structure has a shelf life a claim about
a published page does not.
