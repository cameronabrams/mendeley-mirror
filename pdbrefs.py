pdbrefs.py -- which papers in the library cite which PDB structures.

A fifth of the mirrored papers mention the Protein Data Bank, and the accession
codes are sitting in `text/` already. This reads them out, so "which structures
came from papers we hold?" is a question the library can answer on its own,
without touching RCSB.

    uv run --script pdbrefs.py                 # summary
    uv run --script pdbrefs.py --list          # every accession and who cites it
    uv run --script pdbrefs.py --key Jo2007Automated
    uv run --script pdbrefs.py --id 2HAC       # who cites this structure

**Context is required, and that is the whole design.** A PDB accession is four
characters -- a digit then three alphanumerics -- which also describes "1997",
"3D", "2ND", "1H50" and half the equation labels in a physics paper. Matching the
shape alone produces a long list that looks authoritative and is mostly noise. So
an accession counts only when the surrounding text says it is one: "PDB ID 1ABC",
"PDB code: 1ABC", "Protein Data Bank under accession 1ABC", "rcsb.org/.../1ABC",
and the list forms that follow them ("PDB IDs 1ABC, 2DEF and 3GHI").

**What this necessarily misses, and it should be said rather than discovered.**
A paper that writes a bare "(1ABC)" with no nearby cue is invisible here, and so
is every one of the ~94 attachments with no text layer -- a scanned paper cannot
be grepped at all. The subtilisin paper filed this week deposits 1SCD and says so
in a footnote on a scanned page: this script will never see it. **Treat the output
as a floor, never as a census.**

Requiring a cue also quietly excludes accessions that appear only inside tables,
and that is a feature. A table's text layer interleaves columns and glues
footnote markers onto the cells, so Jo 2007's table yields "1SU44" and "2A654" --
right structures, wrong strings. Cued prose is the reliable source; a table needs
the rendered page, as it does for every other kind of number.
